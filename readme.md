# Introduction to Economic Growth
These are the support files for Chad Jones' and Dietrich Vollrath's \textit{Introduction to Economic Growth}, 4th Edition.

1. Code. These are python scripts that produce figures for the book (both data plots and function plots) as well as tables. File names are descriptive (e.g. Book_Ch3_Fig1.py produces Chapter 3 Figure 1). There is a common library of functions in "Book_Functions.py" that solves models or opens and prepares datasets that are reused.

2. Data. CSV files from various sources (see book for references) used to produce plots. There may be some residual files floating around in there which are unused. 

3. Figures. EPS and PDF copies of figures from the book, produced by the code. You'll need these to recompile the slides if you want to do that. 

4. Slides. Minimal LateX slides containing key equations and figures for each chapter. Feel free to customize to your courses purposes.
